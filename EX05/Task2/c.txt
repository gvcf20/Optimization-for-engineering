c) Although, in this task, only two unknown parameters need to be determined, the 
computation time required to solve this task is significantly greater than that of 
Task 1. How can this be explained? 

Solving this task involved solving a diferential equation. So even though it has less
parameters to fit, the step od solving the diferential equation at each step highly
increases computational complexity.
