What advantages does this approach offer compared to 
the approach of Task 1?

The linear approach offers faster computation, guaranteed 
global optimality, and simpler implementation compared to the 
nonlinear method used in Task 1. It avoids iterative solving, 
making it more stable and easier to analyze statistically. 
However, this comes at the cost of potentially less accurate 
parameter estimation, since linearization can distort the original 
model’s error structure.

How  can  you  explain  the deviations compared to the results
of Task 1?

The deviations compared to Task 1 arise because the linear approach 
is based on a logarithmic transformation of the original model, which 
changes the nature of the error — it minimizes errors in ln(G) 
rather than in G itself. This transformation can distort the 
influence of data points, especially when G spans several orders of 
magnitude, leading to different parameter estimates and a poorer fit 
in the original space.
