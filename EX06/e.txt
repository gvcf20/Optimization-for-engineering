e)  Compare  the  methods  of  tasks  c)  and  d)  regarding  accuracy,  
efficiency  and  applicability. 
Discuss your optimized packaging dimensions critically.

I) Accuracy
Solving the constrained problem we get a much more accurate
solution, since the constrains forbiden the result to be out
of bounds. On the other hand, when using penalty functions,
violations of the constrains are not forbiden but penalized.
Also, when using penalty functions, the problem becomes
dependent on the penalty parameters, that when bigger improve
accuracy but can cause ill-conditioning problems if are over
dimensionated.

II) Efficiency

When using the constrained problem, we solve a smaller and 
better conditionade problem and the solver for it self uses
deticated algorithms. On the other hand, although we used 
the same solver for the unconstrained problem, we need to 
tune the penalty parameters for a more accurate solution, 
which can take a lot of time, reducing efficiency.

III) Applicability

The constrained method are very useful for problems that 
require a lot of accuracy, but we are dependent of solvers
that can handle constrains. The penalty method is very usefull
when the solver does not support the constrains we need.
