'''
d)  Solve the optimization problem of task a) by using a built-in solver for 
constrained optimization problems. In MATLAB you may use fmincon. Python 
users may apply scipy.minimize. Formulate your objective function in such 
a way that it returns the packaging surface A for any vector x = [x1, x2 ,x3 ]T. Use 
the SQP algorithm to solve the problem.
