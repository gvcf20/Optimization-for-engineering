Task 2

a)
From the plot, we can conclude that this method becomes smoother with the reduction
of the step size. On the other hand, we observe that the smaller the step size,
the more steps are required for convergence. We can also conclude that the solution
of the ODE converges to y = 2.

b)
The implicit method is much more stable than the explicit method. 
For the 0.4 step size, we clearly see a much more stable convergence, 
without divergent values during the solution. As in (a), we observe that the 
smaller the step size, the more steps are required to reach convergence. 
This method also requires the use of an external solver to solve a linear equation 
within each iteration, which improves accuracy but also increases the computational 
effort needed.

c)
Using solve_ivp in Python, we obtain a plot very similar to the one obtained using 
the implicit Euler method. Using the BDF method, we reach an answer in 31 steps, 
while with RK45 it takes 65 steps to reach convergence, since this method oscillates 
significantly around the desired solution.
